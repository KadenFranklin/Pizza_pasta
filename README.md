# Pizza_pasta

Given a large dataset of images and text that are somewhat personal, such as a social media account, and some tools such as OpenCV. Is it possible to determine the favorite aspect of someone’s life? Such as their favorite kind of pizza? It might not be too far a stretch for a pizza connoisseur, but might we be able to delve deeper. In my project I will analyze posts from Eric_thepizzaguy on Instagram to try and categorize some of his favorite things. He also frequently has posts dedicated to students, coworkers, and even visitors sometimes. In this project I will use Harr-cascade detection to find Eric’s favorite person by popularity on posts. There are already modules pre trained for facial recognition, also available under OpenCV. I will attempt to have the module produce frequency count if it can distinguish a person between different images. I will also attempt to train a Harr-cascade classifier to recognize different kinds of pizza. In order to do this I will need to have a set of positive samples (images with features you want to detect) and negative samples (images with features you do not want to detect). If I can successfully train the algorithm to detect different features of the of different pizzas. Then I can assemble a frequency chart for pizza over time, and adequately determine Eric’s favorite kind of pizza.
